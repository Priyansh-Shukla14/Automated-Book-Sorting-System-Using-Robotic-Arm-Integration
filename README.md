# Automated Book Sorting System

## Description
Team project to develop a rover-mounted robotic arm system that autonomously picks up books and places them in designated locations. 
Controlled using Arduino, with all mechanical components designed in SolidWorks.

## Contents
- **Arduino_Code/**: Arduino sketches controlling the rover and robotic arm
- **SolidWorks/**: CAD models of the arm components
- **Documentation/**: Report, Poster, Presentation
- **Video/**: Demo video showing the system in action

## How to Run
1. Assemble the rover and robotic arm as per SolidWorks design.
2. Upload Arduino code to the controller.
3. Operate rover to pick and place books manually or through code.
